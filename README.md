# restaurantSite

This is a site that I have made using Bootstrap 4 and its features. If you would like to view the site read the instructions below or view the images attached! Please note that the menu page has not been created.

## Download Instructions

Clone the repository in a convenient location and navigate to it in your terminal or command prompt. Run the following command in your terminal window once you are in the right directory:

```npm install```

If this does not work, use the following command:

```npm install --force```

Once the node modules are installed, in your terminal run the command:

```npm start```

wait for your development server to load, and explore the site!
